# Survival guide for Finland

## Taxation

### I'm doing freelance which is being paid to my foreign(non-Finnish) account.
Report using the file, `files/abroad_income_report_form.pdf`.

### I paid my piano for 4K.
You don't need to report if your yearly used-item sale is under 5K.

### My parents are sending me money.
#### I'm a student.
For daily expense such as grocery and rent, you don't need to pay any tax.
#### Otherwise,
No tax until 5K but still need to report.
